This is a project solely dedicated to immortalizing the existence of Small Cat.

Small Cat Bot is a project for personal use on Discord, and will be not be seeing consistent maintenance. 

#TO-DO 
1. Figure out a more elegant solution for deleting messages
    (Current thought process -- clone the channel)
2. Set up MongoDB and just take in all chat data, as well as images
3. Store image files on S3?
